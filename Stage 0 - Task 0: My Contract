MY CONTRACT

As I go through the CareerHack Program, I hope to learn more about Data analysis
and  Python/Programming.

Some challenges I may face are the distance and having virtual-remote classes, frustration, having short time to practice and the challenge of not knowing programming languages.

To deal with these challenges I plan to give my best, pay attention in classes and to organice my schedule to complete all my goals.

During the program, I commit to putting time aside for myself, because I want to achieve my goal of getting an interesting job.
